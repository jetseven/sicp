<h1>Introductory assignment</h1>
<br>
<h3>Relevant section in text: 1.1</h3>

The goal of this initial assignment is to get students typing at the
computer and running Scheme.  It deals with evaluating simple
expressions, both on paper and using the interpreter, and it
introduces some of the basic mechanics of using the Edwin editor.

<p>

This assignment also introduces the Scheme debugger. In our teaching,
we've found it very valuable to get students using the debugger right
at the outset.  This helps instill the habit of thinking about the
errors they encounter, which saves a lot of grief in later
assignments.  The assignment also includes some playing around with
the ways in which our computers at MIT are connected to the rest of the
network.

<p>

In order to make much use of this assignment (beyond the simple
evaluation exercises) you will need to be running the Edwin editor
and integrated debugger, which is included with the MIT
distribution of Scheme.  If you are not using this version of Scheme,
we suggest that you create an analogous initial assignment to give
students experience with the simple mechanics of using the system,
before they have to confront the more difficult conceptual material to
come.
